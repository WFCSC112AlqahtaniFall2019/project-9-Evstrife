From the result of this project, we can conclude that the bubble sort is the most inefficient way to sort data. By time complexity analysis we've learned in class, we knew that the time complexity for bubble sort is O(n^2)for worst case and O(n)for best case. From the result of running time, we found that sorting time is significantly shortened in the second round of sortin, which is the best case. However, my selection sort algorithm doesn't have a significant change in runtime comparing the best and worst case, because the algorithm was not optimized. In general, bubble sort and selection sort are two of the most time-consuming way to sort the data. Especially for large scale that, we should take other more efficient sorting algorithm for time-saving purpose.
